# Questions to Carlo Rovelli

*Johannes Siedersleben, Tuntenhausen, September 2023*

Outline

1) Why does mathematics work so well? How is it possible that mathematics leads us so far,
that, starting from a few postulates and the right Lagrangian, 
we can derive deep theories from an armchair.
2) What's the point in asking whether physics is real? Are electrons real? Quarks? Time?
We have an intuitive idea, and we have a theory. See van Fraassen
3) What is observable or thinkable? We are an insignificant species, not the centre of the world.
The benefits: humility, resilience.
4) Evolution: immediate consequence -- we are open to other forces out there. The tautology of selection: 
Does a species fit into its environment because it has survived, 
or has it survived because it fits into its environment?
5) Rise and fall of theories, of schools. There is an ongoing competition and we are part of it. 
This is exactly the opposite of the anything-goes attitude
of moral relativism: We take sides, we defend our positions and attack others. 
And there is no law that says who wins.


### 1 Why does mathematics work so well?

Technically, classical mechanics is based on the concept of volume-less particles and two principles:
the principle of symmetry (you can't tell which train is moving) and the principle of least action, which
says that every object behaves in a way that causes the least amount of mess. Everyone is free to
develop their own mechanics based on the principles of their choice, but these two have proved
extremely useful. From the concept and the principles mentioned you can derive the equations of classical
mechanics from your armchair using mathematics. And back in your lab, you'll find your results confirmed.

Conceptually, classical mechanics is a model in our
brain (or on paper, in computers) that happens to fit (or to model) reality in such a way that we can
make predictions: we can calculate the fall of a raindrop, the trajectory of a ball, the flight of a rocket,
and virtually any motion if we know the masses and forces. It cannot be emphasized enough that
such a model is nothing more than a description of reality with some limited precision. A falling stone
is completely ignorant of Newton, stones have always fallen in the same way. To say that a stone falls
the way it does *because of Newton’s laws* would be completely wrong. There are alternative models,
such as those of Aristotle, of Einstein and of quantum mechanics. While Aristotle’s model is useless
and forgotten, the other two are more accurate than Newton’s, have a wider scope but are more
complicated. Here is my point: a model like classical mechanics or any other can be more or less
useful, more or less accurate. But it cannot be true or false. Physics provides models
of varying quality and applicability.

Mathematics is just symbol manipulation, as has been made clear by the Curry-Howard isomorphism.

In retrospect, physics boils down to this:
You are given the postulate of least action, formalised by the Euler-Lagrange equation.
All you have to do for a given system is find the Lagrangian and plug it into Euler-Lagrange. 
Let's take the Maxwell equations as an example. Two of them follow directly
from the definition of the electric field $E$ and the magnetic field $B$,
and you get the other two in a few lines of calculation if you start with L = 1/2(E2 - B2)
The famous laws such as
the continuity equation, Ampère's law, Maxwell's law, Coulomb's law and probably many more
follow by applying mechanically suitable integral or differential operators to one of the 
Maxwell's equations. What are we doing here? 
 






I said that classical mechanics can be derived from an armchair using mathematics. Imagine this: You
start with two innocent principles, you calculate a few pages, and you end up with a model that
describes the world. *Why does mathematics work so well?* This is really mind-blowing and makes
even the most hardened atheist pause for thought. Einstein's booklet *On Cosmic Religion* is all about
this miracle. Is it explicable? The debate is ongoing.


Relativity and quantum mechanics are
models in exactly the same way as classical mechanics. Classical mechanics fails when there are two
or more observers travelling at high relative speed, and it also fails when distances get close to the
wavelength of light. Relativity comes in for high speeds (but is valid for all speeds), and quantum
mechanics comes in for small distances (but is valid for all distances). Both theories generalize
classical mechanics, which is a special case of both. We could discard classical mechanics altogether
and replace it with one of the two modern systems, but we prefer simplicity to a precision we don't
need. Relativity postulates a third principle in addition to the two we have seen, namely that
the speed of light is the same for all observers, no matter how fast they are travelling. Like all
principles, the constancy of the speed of light is only an observation that cannot be proved. Quantum
mechanics does not require any additional principles, but it replaces the volume-less particles of
classical mechanics with wave functions, which can be used to calculate the probability of a particle
having a particular property, such as position or momentum. Given the concepts and principles
involved, you can derive both theories from your armchair, using mathematics that is slightly more
complicated for quantum mechanics. And again, back in your lab, you'll find your results confirmed.
So the miracle goes on and on and on. Imagine all these famous
and utterly unfathomable results, such as *E = mc<sup>2</sup>*, Schrödinger’s equation, or the Heisenberg
Uncertainty Principle, popping up after a few lines of calculation using mathematics that existed long
before. A puzzling question remains:
How on earth could someone (in this case Schrödinger) come up with the outlandish idea of
replacing particles with wave functions? Is this another miracle? Evolution might be an explanation,
I'll return to this point in section (5).

Classical mechanics is counterintuitive, but we are somehow used to it. We simply believe that we are
moving through space at 67,000 mph, we see cars driving and planes flying – physics seems to
work. But relativity and quantum mechanics are not only counterintuitive, they defy our reason.
Relativity involves time dilation, length contraction and a host of paradoxes that no one can imagine or 
understand in the usual sense of the word. And yet, they follow easily from the equations.
Quantum mechanics is even worse: small particles no longer exist; the equations
give probabilities rather than certainties. And then there is quantum entanglement, the basis of
quantum computers, which leaves you stunned. What does this mean for questions of
existence, of causality? Are these problems just problems within physical models, or are they
somehow real? Has our common sense become useless or misleading? The bad news is that both
philosophy and religion have the enormous task of digesting these results and adapting their existing
teachings accordingly. But this is a challenge, not a threat.

Is there any point in asking if, say, electrons, are real? We had to give at lot, e.g. simultaneity. 
The very notion of time is put into question. What on earth will be left?


### 2 What is observable or thinkable?

This question depends on what we can perceive and what we can think. It considers us humans to be the
centre of the world, but we're definitely not. We are rather an insignificant species, tiny creatures, 
living for a few world seconds on a planet that
is not even a grain of dust in the universe, equipped with the senses and the brain that evolution has
happened to give us. We don't smell carbon monoxide because it hardly exists in nature, we have no
sense of radioactivity because the little to be found doesn't threaten us. Yes, we have managed to
build powerful tools for analysing and understanding the world, but are we allowed to think that
what we perceive is all there is? No, I don't think we are. Science is limited to logic and perception;
logic is limited to what our brains can think; perception, by definition, is limited to what we can
perceive. Imagine this: In addition to the four fundamental forces of physics, 
there may be a fifth force that can only be detected by senses that are not available to us, 
and that produces side effects that we can perceive at random intervals of many millions of years. 
Such a force cannot be ruled out, and the observed side effects would be
considered miracles. So there is a veil that separates the perceivable world from everything else.
This veil is indisputable, unless you claim that what we perceive is all there is.

What do I learn if I don't? First of all, I become humble. Modesty is an essential virtue of science: the
awareness that there is a lot we know and can be proud of, but that there is a lot more out there that
we don't yet know, and even more that we will never know. Secondly, it makes me resistant to any
attack by supposed or real miracles. Faked or supposed miracles are easily debunked. But consider a phenomenon 
that has been witnessed beyond any
reasonable doubt and cannot be explained by the available science. No problem! It is just another
challenge for science, which may or may not be met. And if not, don't worry! No one is claiming that
science can explain everything!



### 3 Evolution

In his book, *On the Origin of Species*, Darwin conveys two messages: (1) the evolution of animals from
single-celled organisms to Homo sapiens and (2) the mechanisms of mutation and selection. When he
says that animals evolved over millions of years, he contradicts the Bible in at least two ways: first, he
claims, animals were not created in one day, and second, they were not perfect. If they had been
perfect at the time of creation, as many theists purport, there would have been no need for
evolution. But Darwin says nothing about the Creator. He is not claiming, as some pretend, that
everything happened by itself or by chance. Rather, he says what happened, what the mechanisms
are, and that's it.

The mechanism of mutation and selection can be easily verified in a test tube using rapidly reproducing
bacteria. As for selection, a word is in order: selection in the sense of
*survival of the fittest* is a tautology, there is nothing to
prove and nothing to deny: The living species are those that haven't disappeared, just as the living
people are those that haven't died, the standing buildings are those that haven't been demolished,
the existing religions are those that haven't disappeared, the companies that are in business are
those that haven't gone bankrupt, and so on. This obvious fact is sometimes forgotten: standing in
front of an ancient building, some visitors would say to themselves: oh yes, the builders of yesteryear
knew how to make their work last. But these visitors are admiring a building that happens to be still
standing, regardless of the many that have disappeared. 



### 5 Rise and fall of theories

Soft sciences include law, history, literature, political
science, religious studies, philosophy and so on. They are, in a much stronger sense than the hard
sciences, an eternal discourse because they lack a criterion of truth. 
Who is right? Plato or Aristotle, Hume or Kant, Hajek or Keynes? 
They all have good points, but none is decisive.

The evolution argument leads us a long way:
I said earlier that both the hard and soft sciences are an eternal discourse,
a sequence of competing theories that come and go without ever reaching a conclusion.
Let's assume that selection also applies to physical theories: the ones we use (Newton, Einstein,
quantum physics) are the ones that haven't disappeared like those of Aristotle and countless others:
published, criticised, refuted, forgotten. Then Schrödinger's brilliant idea 
(replacing particles with wave functions) is like a building still 
standing among many others that have collapsed. Now, take the question of morality:
Moral systems have varied greatly throughout human history and across the countries of the world: 
we have seen human sacrifice, torture, capital punishment, slavery, vendetta, all of which seem to have been 
to be outlawed by now, at least in most Western countries. Here is the argument: 
The society with a better moral system has a better chance of survival. Vendetta, for example,
is a bad system that undermines the future of the country, so it is almost gone.
If it is true that moral systems are subject to Darwinian selection, then they are unlikely to 
converge on an ultimate solution, and there is no point in searching for one. Instead, 
we are all a part of this eternal discourse, 
taking sides, defending our favourites and fighting all the others. Notice that this is exactly 
the opposite of the anything-goes attitude of moral relativity.
The next paragraph should sound familiar.



### 6 The Veil

For the atheist, this is where the story ends. The theist might say: Oh yes, that's fantastic! It's behind
the veil where God lives, where the ghosts are, where my ancestors float around and send me signals
and so on. So what?
